Who are the people behind the LabInform datasafe?

The whole LabInform infrastructure and concept is the brainchild of Till Biskup, and he still is the main developer and mastermind behind both, LabInform in general and its individual components, here in particular the LabInform datasafe.

Key parts of the LOI handling and the manifest creation have been contributed by Mirjam Schr√∂der.
