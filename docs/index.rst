LabInform datasafe documentation
================================

*A local repository for "warm" research data.*

Welcome! This is the documentation for the LabInform datasafe component, the **local repository for "warm" research data** that is part of the `LabInform laboratory information and management system <https://www.labinform.de/>`_ (LIMS). One key aspect of handling data is to safely store them in one place and access them via **unique and stable identifiers** (here: a *Lab Object Identifier*, LOI). While data belonging to (textual) publications can often be stored in public repositories, we need a safe place for all our (unpublished) data, starting with their acquisition and independent of their current state. This is meant by "warm" research data -- a term coined by `scientists from KIT <https://doi.org/10.5334/dsj-2021-008>`_.


Features
========

A list of features, not all implemented yet but aimed at for the first public release:

* Repository for "warm" research data: one central place

* Access to data using unique and persistent IDs (*Lab Object Identifier*, LOI)

* Client-server architecture, supporting local and network operation

* Full control over the data: runs locally on your own hardware

* Automatic generation of unique IDs for data

* Pre-register IDs before starting the data acquisition.

* Checksums for automatically checking data integrity


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.9)

* Developed fully test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation


.. warning::
  The LabInform datasafe component is currently under active development and still considered in Beta development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.


Requirements
============

The LabInform datasafe package comes with a rather minimal set of requirements:

* Python >= 3.9
* flask and oyaml packages

A note on the logo
==================

The "L" of the LabInform logo originates from the Computer Modern Roman font originally designed by Donald E. Knuth for his TeX typesetting system. As such, it represents science and the scientific method. Harbouring the "i" representing the information bit puts things right: Proper and reproducible science is the solid support for all the information we can retrieve. The copyright of the LabInform logo belongs to J. Popp. The added symbol on the bottom right is taken from FontAwesome.
