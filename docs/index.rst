LabInform datasafe documentation
================================

Welcome! This is the documentation for the LabInform datasafe component, the **data store** that is part of the `LabInform laboratory information and management system <https://www.labinform.de/>`_ (LIMS).

One key aspect of handling data is to store them in one place and access them via unique identifiers (here: a *Lab Object Identifier*, LOI). The data storage component of the LabInform framework is the datasafe documented here.


.. note::
   This documentation will most probably eventually become part of the general `LabInform documentation <https://docs.labinform.de/>`_. There, you can find already some more general information concerning LabInform.


Features
========

A list of features, not all implemented yet but aimed at for the first public release:

* Client-server architecture

* Local install as well as network install possible

* Automatic generation of unique LOIs


And to make it even more convenient for users and future-proof:

* Open source project written in Python (>= 3.7)

* Developed fully test-driven

* Extensive user and API documentation

.. warning::
  The LabInform datasafe component is currently under active development and still considered in Alpha development state. Therefore, expect frequent changes in features and public APIs that may break your own code. Nevertheless, feedback as well as feature requests are highly welcome.

A note on the logo
==================

The "L" of the LabInform logo originates from the Computer Modern Roman font originally designed by Donald E. Knuth for his TeX typesetting system. As such, it represents science and the scientific method. Harbouring the "i" representing the information bit puts things right: Proper and reproducible science is the solid support for all the information we can retrieve. The copyright of the LabInform logo belongs to J. Popp. The added symbol on the bottom right is taken from FontAwesome.
