Who is the target audience of the LabInform datasafe? Is it interesting for me?


Scientists interested in reproducible research
==============================================

Key to science is reproducibility of the results of others (including "past me"), *i.e.* independence of the results and conclusions from the individual scientist. This was always the case, but has become more pressing due to the increasing amount of (scientific) data produced.


Small academic groups with limited IT support
=============================================

Large academic groups or the industry usually have a dedicated IT infrastructure and support providing them with data storage solutions and, what is crucially important, the capacity to adapt these software services to the local and dedicated needs.

Small and particularly academic groups usually do not have the financial and personal capacity to buy and adapt commercial solutions, let alone the intrinsic resistance to being forced into a certain workflow by external tools. Therefore, a solution with a small technological footprint that can be easily adapted by the scientists themselves to their individual needs is of great interest. This is what the LabInform datasafe aims at providing.
